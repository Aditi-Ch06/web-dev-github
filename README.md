#My SI Dev Challenge - First Frontend Task - Marvel SuperHero Information Booklet

I have made a website on it with my prior knowledge of frontend development including HTML,CSS,Javascript.

I also tried attempting the bonus part i.e, the API Integration and Responsiveness and deploying the website online,but was facing some errors,so coudn't make a dynamic website within the given time but still sharing that code also as commented in my code to make you aware of my progress.

While doing this project I gained practical experience,which i enjoyed a lot,and I will be definitely working on this project ahead also and would love to work on many other such and even diverse projects,contributing best of mine.

Currently in WebD I have learned the Frontend and is practicing different projects on it and have started learning backend.

Love Peace Code
