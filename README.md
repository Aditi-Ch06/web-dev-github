#My SI Dev Challenge - First Frontend Task - Marvel SuperHero Information Booklet

I have made a website on it with my prior knowledge of frontend development including HTML,CSS,Javascript.

I also tried attempting the bonus part i.e, the API Integration and Responsiveness,but was facing some errors,so coudn't make a dynamic website within the given time but still sharing that code also as commented in my code to make you aware of my progress.

Currently in WebD I have learned the Frontend and is practicing different projects on it and have started learning backend.
